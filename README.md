# Payroll-management-system
This project implements a Payroll Management System on an Arduino Uno that processes serial commands to manage employee payroll records. It uses a finite state machine to coordinate serial input, LCD display, and button navigation, enabling account management and tax/pension calculations in real time under embedded constraints.
